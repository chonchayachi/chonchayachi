👋 Hello world, I’m Chonchaya Chiangsaen 

🚀 **About Me**<br>
  I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Nursing Science. Now, I’m currently learning about Medical bioinformatics in Master Degree,Mahidol university<br>
  
💻 **Why I interested in Bioinformatics** 🧬 <br>
  Nowadays, I’ve been working as a registered nurse in the ward of the inpatient surgery department for three years. Since my time as a nursing student and now working as a registered nurse, I have seen a lot of different diagnoses and symptoms caused by heredity. It sparks my interest in genetics. I also know that studying modern genetics requires knowledge of computer science to process and analyze effectively and efficiently. For example, Gene therapy in Carcinoma patients. However, my daily job does not provide an environment to pursue this kind of knowledge, and the majority of my colleagues do not interest in this field. This is the reason why I seek admission to Mahidol university for the course Medical Bioinformatics.
